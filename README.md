# Donut Shop

A ruby application given as part of a live-code clinic to teach students about test-driving the development of Ruby classes and methods. Students should run `rspec` to get failing tests, and then write the code in the empty class files to get those tests to pass. There are also comments in the `box_spec.rb` that guide students to write new tests before writing the methods to make those tests pass.

## Set Up

To get set up, run the following: 

```no-highlight
  bundle
  rspec
```
